1.0.1.dev
----------------------------

- improved documentation (thanks Laurent Brack)

XXX include server/client changelogs

1.0
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- rename "--datadir" to "--serverdir" to better match
  the also picked up DEVPI_SERVERDIR environment variable.

- fix a strange effect in that sometimes tools ask to receive
  a package url with a "#md5=..." arriving at the server side.
  We now strip that part out before trying to serve the file.

- on startup don't create any initial indexes other 
  than the "root/pypi" pypi caching mirror.

- introduce ``--start``, ``--stop`` and ``--log`` commands for
  controling a background devpi-server run. (these commands
  previously were implemented with the devpi-client and the "server"
  sub command)

- fix issue27: provide full list of pypi names in root/pypi's simple
  view (and simple pages from inheriting indices)

- default to "eventlet" server when creating deployment with --gendeploy

- fix issue25: return 403 Forbidden when trying to delete the root user.

- fix name mangling issue for pypi-cache: "project_name*" is now matched
  correctly when a lookup for "project-name" happens.

- fix issue22: don't bypass CDN by default, rather provide an
  "--bypass-cdn" option to do it (in case you have cache-invalidation troubles)

- fix issue20 and fix issue23: normalize index specs internally ("/root/dev" ->
  "root/dev") and check if base indices exist.

- add Jenkins build job triggering for running the tests for a package
  through tox.

- inheritance cleanup: inherited versions for a project are now shadowed
  and not shown anymore with getreleaselinks() or in +simple pages
  if the "basename" is exactly shadowed.

- fix issue16: enrich projectconfig json with a "+shadow" file which
  lists shadowed "versions"

- initial wheel support: accept "whl" uploads and support caching 
  of whl files from pypi.python.org

- implemented internal push operation between devpi indexes

- show "docs" link if documentation has been uploaded

- pushing releases to pypi.python.org will now correctly 
  report the filetype/pyversion in the metadata.

- add setting of acl_upload for indexes.   Only the owning
  user and acl_upload users may upload releases, files 
  or documentation to an index.

- add --passwd USER option for setting a user's password server-side

- don't require email setting for creating users

devpi-client:

- removed ``server`` subcommand and options for controling background devpi-server
  processes to become options of ``devpi-server`` itself.

- fix issue14: lookup "python" from PATH for upload/packaging activities instead of
  using "sys.executable" which comes from the interpreter executing the "devpi" script.
  This allows to alias "devpi" to come from a virtualenv which is separate from
  the one used to perform packaging.

- fix issue35: "devpi index" cleanly errors out if no index is
  specified or in use.

- remember authentication on a per-root basis and cleanup "devpi use"
  interactions.  This makes switching between multiple devpi instances
  more seemless.

- fix issue17: better reporting when "devpi use" does not operate on valid URL

- test result upload and access: 
  - "devpi test" invokes "tox --result-json ..." and uploads 
    the test result log to devpi-server.  
  - "devpi list [-f] PKG" shows test result information.

- add "uploadtrigger_jenkins" configuration option through "devpi
  index".

- fix issue19: devpi use now memorizes --venv setting properly. Thanks Laurent.

- fix issue16: show files from shadowed versions 

- initial wheel support: "devpi upload --format=bdist_wheel" now uploads
  a wheel format file to the index.  (XXX "devpi install" will trigger
  pip commands with option "--use-wheels".)

- fix issue15: docs will now be built via "setup.py build_sphinx" 
  using a internal build dir so that the upload succeeds if conf.py
  would otherwise specify a non-standard location.

- implement and refine "devpi push" command.  It now accepts
  two forms "user/name" for specifying an internal devpi index
  and "pypi:REPONAME" for specifying a repository which must be
  defined in a .pypirc file.
  
- remove spurious pdb.set_trace() in devpi install command when
  no pip can be found.

- show and allow to set "acl_upload" for uploading priviliges

- add longer descriptions to each sub command, shown with
  "devpi COMMAND -h".

- removed pytestplugin support for now (pytest reporting directly to
  devpi-server)


0.9.4
----------------------------

server: 

- fix issue where lookups into subpages of the simple index
  (simple/NAME/VER) would not trigger a 404 as they should.

client:

- fix uploading by adding setup.py's dir to sys.path:  setup.py 
  files that import modules/packages for obtaining versions etc.
  now work. Thanks jbasko.

- fix automatic devpi-server startup on python26/windows 


0.9.3
----------------------------

server:

- fixed issue9: caching of packages where upstream provides no
  last-modified header now works.

- fixed issue8: only http/https archives are allowed and other
  schemes (such as ftp) are silently skipped

- added support for REST DELETE methods of projects and versions on an index

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)

client:

- new "devpi list" command to show projects of the in-use index or all
  release files of a project with "devpi list PROJECTNAME".

- new "devpi remove" command to remove releases from the current index,
  including any contained release files

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)


0.9.2 (compared to 0.9.1)
----------------------------

server:

- fix /USER/INDEXNAME root views to contain only latest in-stage packages

- make +api calls return bases so that "devpi use" can show them

client:

- introduce "devpi upload --fromdir" for uploading archives in bulk
  mode, thanks to Anthon van der Neut for helping with this!  (resolved issue5)

- improve automatic server handling via "devpi use"

- for "devpi server" you now need to specify "--log" to see log lines

- make "devpi use" also show base indexes by default

- fix issue4: auto-server data stored in non-dot dir


0.9.1 (compared to 0.9.0)
----------------------------

server:

- return 404 for submits to root/pypi

- properly sorted release file links on stage indexes

- "push" method on indexes for transfering release files to another
  pypi index

- properly handle urls from indexes with ~ and other special chars

- fix root/pypi and root/dev page serving in various cases

client:

- refined "python setup.py" calls from ``devpi upload`` with proper
  ``__file__`` attributes.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.

- implemented new "devpi push" command for pushing out releases

- improved error handling for devpi upload

- fix logoff if not logged in

- don't use --force-reinstall when using pip
