Project status, roadmap and contact
----------------------------------------

Latest release
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As of August 2013, both ``devpi-server`` and the ``devpi`` tools 
are released as 1.0 packages under the MIT license.  Around 380
automated tests are passing on python2.7 and python2.6 on 
Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7.


Development background and road map
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The MIT-licensed project is partly funded by a contract between a
geo-distributed company and merlinux_ with Holger Krekel as the lead
developer.  The project is actively developed and bound to see more
releases in 2013, in particular in these areas:

- bugfixes, maintenance, streamlining
- real-time mirroring between devpi-server instances

**One area that is lacking is the web UI**.  I am looking for funding
and/or a partner to push forward with the web UI and design.  The server 
provides an evolving :doc:`REST API <curl>` to begin with.
