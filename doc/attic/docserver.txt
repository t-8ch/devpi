Server data directory layout (implementation internal)
------------------------------------------------------

All paths are shown relative to the ``serverdata`` directory which
defaults to ``~/.devpi/server`` and can be changed from the command line::

::
    .secret  default location for file containing the server-side secret
             used for authentication

    <user>/.config  configuration for the user including which indexes are
                    present

    <user>/<index>/links/<project>  dictionary of basenames->relative links

    <user>/<index>/files/<MD5>/<releasefilebasename>
