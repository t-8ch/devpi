replication issues
------------------------

- pushrelease operation should happen at model level?

- replica/master authentication handling: currently salt-hashed passwords leak through
  replication protocol.  Should replica's get a key which needs to be generated
  by the master? 

- remove unbounded cache for transaction entries

keyfs 
------------------

- durability: fsync on commit

- remove mkdtempdir() / web needs to manage its own directories

deployment / API
-----------------

- instead of the replica thread polling every five secs, do a long-poll

- use a unified API for Thread/background task handling
  based on threading.Thread

ext pypi mirror
--------------------

- what happens when the master is upgraded / removes root/pypi state?
