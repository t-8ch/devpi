devpi-2.0.0: web, search, replication for PyPI indexes
==========================================================

The devpi system in version 2.0 brings tons of fixes
and new features, most notably:

- a new web interface featuring search of metadata and documentation
  as well as easier navigation.

- a new transactional storage system supporting real-time 
  replication over http.

- a new (experimental) hook system for extending server-side
  functionality.

Note that devpi-2.0 requires to ``--export`` your 1.2 
server state before you can serve it through devpi-2.0.

Here is a Quickstart tutorial for efficient pypi-mirroring 
on your laptop::    
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-pypimirror.html                         
                                                                                
And if you want to manage your releases or implement staging                    
as an individual or within an organisation::                                    
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-releaseprocess.html                     
                                                                                
If you want to permanently install devpi-server and potentially                 
access it from many clients::                                                   
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-server.html
