devpi-2.0.0: web, search, replication for PyPI indexes
==========================================================

The devpi system in version 2.0 brings tons of fixes
and new features for the private github-style pypi caching server, 
most notably:

- a new web interface featuring search of metadata and documentation
  as well as easier navigation and showing of test results per release
  file.

- a new transactional storage system (based on sqlite) supporting 
  real-time replication over http.

- a new (experimental) hook system for extending server-side
  functionality.

- ported to a solid web framework and wsgi-server: pyramid 
  and waitress.

Upgrade note: devpi-server-2.0 requires to ``--export`` your 1.2 
server state and then using ``--import`` with the new version
before you can serve your private packages through devpi-server-2.0.0.  
Also, please checkout the web plugin if you want to have a web interface::

Here is a Quickstart tutorial for efficient pypi-mirroring 
on your laptop::

And if you want to manage your releases or implement staging                    
as an individual or within an organisation::

If you want to host a devpi-server installation with nginx/supervisor
and access it from clients from different hosts::
