devpi: managing and serving Python release processes
===================================================================

``devpi`` is a meta package installing two other packages:

- `devpi-server <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-server>`_: 
  for serving a pypi.python.org consistent
  caching index as well as local github-style overlay indexes.

- `devpi-client <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/devpi-client>`_: 
  command line tool with sub commands for
  creating users, using indexes, uploading to and installing
  from indexes, as well as a "test" command for invoking tox.
