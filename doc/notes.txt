hook semantics for metadata and doc file changes
------------------------------------------------

There are currently two hooks notifying plugins of changes:

    devpiserver_register_metadata(stage, metadata)

    devpiserver_docs_uploaded(stage, name, version, entry)

- Both hooks are called within a read-transaction pointing at the serial
  where the change occured. This means that hooks may read values but
  they cannot write values.

- hook subscribers are called after a transaction has finally
  committed and thus cannot influence the outcome of the transaction
  performing the change.  It is also possible that subscribers
  are called much later because some subscribers may take long
  to complete.

- subscriptions are persistent in the sense that if there is a lag of N
  pending serials where subscribers need to be called, a process restart
  will continue to call the appropriate subscribers after startup.

- hook subscribers are called one after another from the same
  dedicated thread.  Exceptions of a subscriber are logged
  but will not prevent the execution of other subscribers.

- the hook calling thread is managed from the KeyFS instance.

- the hooks are called in the same way from within a master and
  replica process.
